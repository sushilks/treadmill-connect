Document Terminology 
The Bluetooth SIG has adopted portions of the IEEE Standards Style Manual, which dictates use of the 
words “shall’’, “must”, “will”, “should’’, “may’’, and “can’’ in the development of documentation, as 
follows: 
• The word “shall” is used to indicate mandatory requirements strictly to be followed in order to 
conform to the standard and from which no deviation is permitted (shall equals is required to).  
• The use of the word “must” is deprecated and shall not be used when stating mandatory 
requirements; must is used only to describe unavoidable situations. 
• The use of the word “will” is deprecated and shall not be used when stating mandatory 
requirements; will is only used in statements of fact. 
• The word “should” is used to indicate that among several possibilities one is recommended as 
particularly suitable, without mentioning or excluding others; or that a certain course of action is 
preferred but not necessarily required; or that (in the negative form) a certain course of action is 
deprecated but not prohibited (should equals is recommended that). 
• The word “may” is used to indicate a course of action permissible within the limits of the standard 
(may equals is permitted). 
• The word “can” is used for statements of possibility and capability, whether material, physi cal, or 
causal (can equals is able to).

1 Introduction 
The Fitness Machine Service (FTMS) exposes training-related data in the sports and fitness environment, 
which allows a Client to collect training data while a user is exercising with a fitness machine (Server). 
The service also exposes the Training Status characteristic (See Section 4.10) in order to provide 
feedback to the Client about training status (e.g., warming up, low or high intensity phase, etc.) In

Table 4.11: Structure of the Training Status Characteristic 

--- Page 47 ---
 Fitness Machine Service  /  Service Specification 
Bluetooth SIG Proprietary Page 47 of 78 
4.10.1 Characteristic Behavior

0 Training Status String present: 
0 = False 
1 = True 
1 Extended String present: 
0 = False 
1 = True 
2-7 Reserved for Future Use 
Table 4.12: Bit Definitions for the Training State Characteristic 
For low energy, the Training Status characteristic may exceed the current MTU size (i.e., if the Training 
Status String field exceeds the negotiated MTU size minus 5 octets). If the characteristic size exceeds the 
current MTU size, the Server shall set the Extended String bit of the Flags field to 1 to inform the Client 
that additional characters are available and should be read via the appropriate GATT procedure (e.g., 
GATT Read Long procedure). The Server should not update the value more than once in a ten seconds 
period if the Extended String present bit is set to 1 in order to give enough time to the Client to read this 
value. Only the first (ATT_MTU-3) octets of the characteristic value can be included in a notification, but 
the entire string may be read by using the GATT Read Long sub-procedure. 
For BR/EDR, this restriction does not exist due to a larger MTU size.

Table 4.24: Fitness Machine Control Point characteristic – Result Codes 
If an Op Code is written to the Fitness Machine Control Point that results in a successful operation, the 
Server shall indicate the Fitness Machine Control Point with the Response Code Op Code, the Request 
Op Code, and the Result Code set to “Success”. 
If an Op Code is written to the Fitness Machine Control Point and the Server does not permit the control 
to that particular Client, the Server shall respond with the Result Code set to “Control Not Permitted”. 
Depending on the context of the Server, if an Op Code is written to the Fitness Machine Control Point that 
contradicts a previously triggered operation (e.g., the Client sets the targeted speed while targeted 
distance was set or the spin down procedure was ongoing), then previously triggered operation should be 
aborted and the new procedure should be taken into account by the Server. 
If the Start or Resume Op Code is written to the Fitness Machine Control Point that results in an error 
condition (e.g., the fitness machine has already been started), the Server, after sending a Write 
Response, shall indicate the Fitness Machine Control Point with the Response Code Op Code, the 
Request Op Code, and the Result Code set to “Operation Failed”. 
If the Stop or Pause Op Code is written to the Fitness Machine Control Point that results in an error 
condition (e.g., the fitness machine has already been stopped), the Server, after sending a Write 
Response, shall indicate the Fitness Machine Control Point with the Response Code Op Code, the 
Request Op Code, and the Result Code set to “Operation Failed”. 
If an Op Code is written to the Fitness Machine Control Point characteristic that is unsupported by the 
Server (e.g., an Op Code that is Reserved for Future Use), the Server, after sending a Write Response, 
shall indicate the Fitness Machine Control Point with a Response Code Op Code, the Request Op Code, 
and Result Code set to “Op Code Not Supported”. 
If a Parameter is written to the Fitness Machine Control Point characteristic that is invalid (e.g., the Client 
writes the Set Target Speed Op Code with a Parameter that is improperly formatted or that is outside the 

--- Page 66 ---
 Fitness Machine Service  /  Service Specification 
Bluetooth SIG Proprietary Page 66 of 78 
range of the supported values), the Server, after sending a Write Response, shall indicate the Fitness 
Machine Control Point with a Response Code Op Code, the Request Op Code, and Result Code set to 
“Invalid Parameter”. 
If the operation results in an error condition that cannot be reported to the Client using the Fitness 
Machine Control Point (e.g., the Fitness Machine Control Point cannot be indicated), see Section 4.16.3 
for details on handling this condition. 
4.16.3 General Error Handling Procedures 
Other than error handling procedures that are specific to certain Op Codes, the following apply:  
If an Op Code is written to the Fitness Machine Control Point characteristic while the Server is performing 
a previously triggered Fitness Machine Control Point operation (i.e., resulting from invalid Client 
behavior), the Server shall return an error response with the Attribute Protocol error code set to 
“Procedure Already In Progress” as defined in CSS Part B, Section 1.2 [3]. See Appendix 2 for an 
example on how the Server handles this situation. 
If an Op Code is written to the Fitness Machine Control Point characteristic and the Client Characteristic 
Configuration descriptor of the Fitness Machine Control Point is not configured for indications, the Server 
shall return an error response with the Attribute Protocol error code set to “Client Characteristic 
Configuration Descriptor Improperly Configured” as defined in CSS Part B, Section 1.2 [3]. 
4.16.4 Procedure Timeout 
In the context of the Fitness Machine Control Point characteristic, a procedure is started when a write to 
the Fitness Machine Control Point characteristic is successfully completed (i.e., the Server sends a Write 
Response). When a procedure is complete, the Server shall indicate the Fitness Machine Control Point 
with the Op Code set to “Response Code”. 
In the context of the Fitness Machine Control Point characteristic, a procedure is not considered started 
and not queued in the Server when a write to the Fitness Machine Control Point results in an error 
response with an Attribute Protocol error code. 
4.17 Fitness Machine Status 
If the Server supports the Fitness Machine Control Point (see Section 4.16), the Fitness Machine Status 
characteristic shall be exposed by the Server. Otherwise, supporting the Fitness Machine Status 
characteristic is optional. 
The Fitness Machine Status characteristic is used to send the status of the Server. Included in the 
characteristic value is a Fitness Machine Status field, and depending on the value of the Fitness Machine 
Status Field, a Parameter field may also be included. 
The structure of the characteristic is defined below:

4.17.1 Characteristic Behavior 
When the Fitness Machine Status characteristic is configured for notification via the  Client Characteristic 
Configuration descriptor, this characteristic shall be notified when new status information is available 
(e.g., typically within a second after the status change has occurred). 
If the status is updated by the user (e.g., the user increases the speed via the UI of the Server), the 
Server shall notify this characteristic to all connected Clients with the appropriate characteristi c value, as 
defined in Table 4.26. 

--- Page 69 ---
 Fitness Machine Service  /  Service Specification 
Bluetooth SIG Proprietary Page 69 of 78 
If the status is updated by a Client (e.g., a Client increases the speed via the Fitness Machine Control 
Point procedure defined in Section 4.16.2.3), the Server shall notify this characteristic to the other 
connected Clients, if any. 
The Server shall send the Fitness Machine Status notification with the Op Code set to Control Permissio n 
Lost to the Client that has lost control (e.g., control has been revoked by the user via the UI of the Server 
or if another connected Client has requested control). 
The Fitness Machine characteristic contains time-sensitive data; thus the requirements for time-sensitive 
data and data storage defined in Section 4.18 apply. 
4.18 Requirements for Time-Sensitive Data 
The following characteristics contain time-sensitive data: 
• Treadmill Data 
• Cross Trainer Data 
• Step Climber Data 
• Stair Climber Data 
• Rower Data 
• Indoor Bike Data 
• Training Status 
• Fitness Machine Status 
The following requirements apply to these time-sensitive characteristics: 
• If a link loss occurs while the Server sends a Data Record in multiple notifications, the Data Record 
shall be discarded and shall not be sent to the Client if the connection is reestablished.  
• Since this service does not provide any data with a time stamp to identify the measurement time (and 
age) of the data (the Elapsed Time feature refers to the relative time since the training session has 
started and not to a time stamp that includes the date-time information), the value of the 
characteristics (mentioned above) that can be notified shall not be stored in the Server if either the 
connection is not established or if the notification is not successfully transmitted (e.g., due to link 
loss). 
4.19 Transmission of a Data Record 
For devices that support the low energy feature of Bluetooth, if a Data Record (see Section 4.1) does not 
exceed the ATT-MTU size and therefore can be sent in one single notification, the More Data bit of the 
Flags field shall be set to 0 and the associated fields shall be included in the notification.  
For devices that support the low energy feature of Bluetooth, if a Data Record (see Section 4.1) exceeds 
the ATT-MTU size, the first notification used to send this Data Record shall have the More Data bit of the 
Flags field set to 1. The subsequent notifications used to send this Data Record shall also h ave the More 
Data bit of the Flags field set to 1, except for the last notification, which shall have the More Data bit of the 
Flags field set to 0. 
There is no additional requirement for BR/EDR devices due to larger MTU.
